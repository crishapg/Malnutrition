Providing children with the right foods at the right time in their development offers disease protection, prevents stunting, wasting and micronutrient deficiencies, and reduces the risk of overweight and obesity.\n\n<img src=\"C:/Users/crish/OneDrive/Documents/GitHub/Malnutrition/Project/images/IYCFpractices.png\" width=\"40%\" position=\"center\" />\n\n###An optimal enabling environment for good nutrition\n\nThere is a need to create an environment in which the policies and programmes that protect and promote infant and young child feeding are broadly supported, sufficiently funded and effectively implemented. An important step in fostering this enabling environment for IYCF is to ensure that a comprehensive policy is in place to galvanize policy action. Results show that countries have consistently adopted IYCF policies, with 96 per cent of countries reporting to have one in place, either as a stand-alone policy or as part a broader nutrition or health policy.\n\n###Map 1. In 2015, 64 out of 98 countries have adopted some legal measures, yet most need to be further strengthened\n\n```{r, include=FALSE}\nlibrary(raster)\nworld_spdf <- shapefile(\"data/world_map/TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3.shp\")\n\n# Merge the QoG data to Shape Files\nlibrary(dplyr)\nIYCF2 <- world_spdf@data %>% left_join(iycf_v2, by = c(FIPS = \"fips\"))\nworld_spdf@data <- IYCF2\n```\n\n\n```{r, echo=FALSE}\n\nleaflet(world_spdf) %>% \n    setView(lat=10, lng=0 , zoom=2) %>%\n    addPolygons(\n    stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.5, smoothFactor = 0.5, \n    color = ~colorFactor(c(\"#ffe2e8\", \"#a09ecc\" , \"#536987\" , \"#2d355a\"), FP_code)(FP_code),\n    popup = paste(\"Country:\",world_spdf$NAME,\"<br/>\",\n                  \"Code:\",world_spdf$FP_code,\"\")) %>%\n  addLegend(\"bottomright\", \n  pal = colorFactor(c(\"#ffe2e8\", \"#2d355a\" , \"#a09ecc\"), world_spdf$FP_code), values = ~FP_code,\n  title = \"\", opacity = 0.5)\n\n```\n\n\n##Prevention of stunting and malnutrition\n\nCounselling on infant and young child feeding can empower mothers and caregivers and boost childrenâ€™s nutritional status during the critical window of the first 1,000 days. \n\nThese figures provide only a partial snapshot of the current situation of infant and young child feeding counselling. There is a need to improve the availability and quality of data by strengthening national information systems and nutrition surveillance systems.\n\n\n###Graph 1.
