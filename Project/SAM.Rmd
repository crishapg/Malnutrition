Globally the number of children admitted to SAM treatment programmes has increased steadily, from 1.4 million in 2009 to 3.53 million children in 2015. The rate of increase is slow compared with previous years.

world_spdf <- shapefile("C:/Users/crish/OneDrive/Documents/Columbia SIPA/2017 Spring/Data Visualization/Final Project/data/world_map/TM_WORLD_BORDERS_SIMPL-0.3.shp")

# Merge the QoG data to Shape Files
library(dplyr)
samburden <- world_spdf@data %>% left_join(sam, by = c(ISO3 = "iso3"))
world_spdf@data <- samburden

```

More children are being treated for SAM than ever before: admissions increased from 3.2 million children from 57 countries in 2014 to 3.5 million children in 68 countries in 2015. However, there is still only a shocking one in five children with SAM receiving lifesaving care.

                      "% Estimated Burden", "% Target Area", "% Admissions")

```

The regional burden and targets, compared with admissions in 2015, make clear that there are still far too many children who require treatment but are being left behind. In Middle East and North Africa and South Asia the coverage rates are low.
